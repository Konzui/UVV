Documentation for version 3.7.2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It only takes .obj files, but most tools can import and export obj-files, so it should work for most usages.

UI version:
-----------
To change the camera press the right mouse button. Right + Left dollys, and Right + middle pans. Multi touch camera controlls also work (two finguers to tumble/zoom and 3 to pan), as well as standard Maya camera controlls by pressing Alt + mouse buttons. 

Click in empty space to go from 3D to UV view and back.

Contact and feedback:
---------------------
If you encounter any issues, please mail me and if possible send me the mesh you have problems with. If you cant send the mesh, a screen shot will also do. If you are having problems, you can turn on the "validate" option in the settings. This will run a bunch of validation steps, and output any error it finds in the betray_stdout.txt file. It only gets better if I know whats wrong with it!

UV mapping is subjective, so if you have opinions please let me know. If you think it sucks LET ME KNOW and tell me why. Word of caution, I am more focused on hand made meshes with good topology then I am with scanned meshes, so that will remain my focus for now.

Follow me on twitter at @quelsolaar I will post when i release new versions, and when issues are fixed.
